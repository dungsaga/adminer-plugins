Some not-so-awesome plugins for the awesome Adminer

* `tables-filter-regex.php`: Filter table names with regex (for each selected database), much faster than the plugin tables-filter in Adminer
* `hidden-and-sticky-columns.php`: Use ctrl+alt+click on column header to hide a column and alt+click to make it sticky
